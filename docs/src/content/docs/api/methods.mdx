Marco provides several methods to help you track custom events, reset all logs at any point, and retrieve performance logs for analysis.

### track

Custom performance markers can be sent at any point in app to measure specific events or actions.

For example:

```tsx
// Without metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now());

// With metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now(), { data: 'meta_data' });
```

:::tip
In order to track native events, use [Native Event Logging](../../api/native-event) methods.
:::

### getLogs

You can retrieve all performance logs asynchronously using the `getLogs` method. This allows you to analyze performance data after it has been collected.

For example:

```tsx
const logs = await PerformanceTracker.getLogs();
```

Logs are structured in a JSON format, and can be analyzed as needed.

:::note
This will give in memory logs. To get logs from device use [generate](../../api/cli/generate-report) command.
:::

### resetLogs

You can clear all performance logs at any time. This can be done through the `resetLogs` method.

For example:

```tsx
// This will clear in memory logs.
PerformanceTracker.resetLogs();

// This will clear in memory logs and also clear the persisted log files if `persistToFile` is true.
PerformanceTracker.resetLogs({ clearFiles: true });
```

This will reset the logs and optionally clear the persisted log files.

:::danger
- `clearFiles` will clear all the logs from the device. Be sure to save the logs before clearing using [generate](../../api/cli/generate-report) command.
- This will clear all the logs from the device, including native events.
